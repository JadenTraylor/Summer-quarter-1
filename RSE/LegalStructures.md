The business I want to start is photograhpy, I want to have a conmpany where you call us to come take some photos at an event because some people don't be having anyone to take photos so I wanna make a comany for that one big reason or I can just be the person that you call to come take some photos for some hours and I would have a menu for you to pick how long you want me to stay and how much it would cost.

Another business idea I have is a site where you can find trainers in your citry or close to you because some people want the extra work instead of just doing at practice but they never know a trainer in their area. I want to make a site to help them out with that, on the site you will put your location and some trainers will pop up and so will their information. You will be able to contact them and have a chat on what times and what days you can train when the training is over you can leave a review on if it was good or bad, if it was bad you can find you another trainer but if it was good u can keep in contact with them and have some more sestions
