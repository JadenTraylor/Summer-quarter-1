    <h1>Sports Journey 2015-2025</h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="sports.css"/>
   I will take you on a journey down memory lane and share with you photographs of my early days playing baseball <br> up to the present, and I will do the same for football and basketball. To begin, I will start with baseball.
    <h1>BASEBALL 2015-2023</h1>
   <section class="image-grid">
      <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/firstyear.jpg" alt="Photo 1"></div>
  <p>This is when I started to play baseball. They put me at 1st base, but I wasn't very good because I wasn't familiar with the game.</p>
  
 <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/secondyear.jpeg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
  <p>This is my second year playing, and they moved me to pitcher and shortstop. I was improving at the game.</p>
  
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/thirdyear.jpeg" alt="Photo 3"></div>
   <p>This is my third year, I ended up playing for a different team because the coach wanted me to come play with them. They had me at the same positios but I was mostly at short stop. I didn't really like this team because the coach was playing favoriteizme so I stop playing with them after the season.</p>
  
   <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/fourthyear.jpeg" alt="Photo 4"></div>
    <p>This is the year I played after covid, and as you can see I am back at 1st base. This year was probably my favorite because we won every game, and it was the most fun year I ever played. During this time, I had a lot of weight on me from being stuck at home all day during covid, so it was harder for me to play since I wasn't used to it.</p>
  
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/fifthyear.jpeg" alt="Photo 5"></div>
   <p>This is the year after I lost all the weight I gained during covid.
This year, we weren't that great of a team, but we still won some games.
I continued playing the same positions because we already had players in the spot I wanted to play, so I returned to my original position.</p>
  
<div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/sixthyear.jpeg" alt="Photo 6"></div>
<p>This was my final year playing baseball because it became boring for me. This year we were an amazing team we had a lot of team spirit, and that helped us win all our games. This year was my best year, I struck out many players and scored a lot of runs for our team.</p>

<div class="basktball">
  <h1>Basketball 2016-2025</h1>
  <section class="image-grid">
    
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball1.JPEG" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This is my first year playing basketball. I joined my baseball coach's team because he believed I had some talent, and he was correct. I was actually good, but I just need to improve on a few more things.</p>

    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball2.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This is my second year and I switched to a differnt team because we were playing in harder tournments so it was more compitention. This is my favorite year out of all of them because this was the best team we had, nobody we played can beat us and we were winning every tournment. At first we could not play as a team, we would be arguing every practice and fighting eachother but the coach we had said he had enough of it and made us work togetther to play as a team, thanks to him we became one of the best teams and started to play team basketball.</p>

    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball3.JPEG" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This year we had the same team as last year and we were doing the same thing we were working together to beat every team. This year was right before we was in our homes for covid, if it wasn't for covid or kobe dying we would of went to LA for the Mamba tournment and I fill like we would've won and met kobe.</p>
    
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball4.jpeg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This year I had the same players on my team, but we had a different coach. The reason for this is that the person in charge of the organization had passed away and my coach had criminal charges, so they wouldn't allow him to coach. We were a good team, but it just wasn't the same without them.</p>
    
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball5.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This year was probably the worst year because everything was new for us. We had new coaches and a new person in charge. Plus some people left, and the new members added to the team weren't very good. We didn't want to quit because we were playing in honor of our coach's death. It was also our last season with the team name because our new coach wanted us to join his organization. You are probably wondering what the team name was and what we switched. The original team name was the Bucketboyz, and we changed the name to Mo Bounce. This year I missed many games because I broke my collarbone when a car hit me. </p>
    
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball6.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This year we changed our name to Mo Bounce. There were only 3 players who were originally on Bucketboyz. We traveled a lot this year and won our first championship game. It was a decent year it could have been better, but I'm happy it wasn't worse.</p>
  
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/basketball7.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>As you may remember from my first page, this is my first year in high school. There isn't much more I can share since I've already mentioned it, but I felt it was important to include it in the journey.</p>

<div class="football">
  <h1>Football 2018-2025</h1>
  <section class="image-grid">
    
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/football1.JPEG" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This is when I began playing football. I wasn't very good, but I was fast. They had me playing wide receiver, but then they switched me to quarterback because they saw I had a strong arm. I improved throughout the year.</p>

    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/Jcowboys.JPG" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This was my second year playing, and it was the worst year for our team. I didn't have good teammates, so we weren't winning any games. But that didn't matter to me because I don't give up, so I stayed with the team until the end. Another bad thing about this year is that our coach quit in the middle of the year, so we had no coach. This year was aslo the fist time I won homecoming king.</p>

    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/football2.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This year was my third year of playing, and I joined a new team in a different league. We were a strong team, but our coaches weren't very good, so they didn't help us improve for the game.</p>
    
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/football3.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
    <p>This is my final year of popwarner before I start high school. This year, we probably had the best team and showed excellent teamwork, but just like last year, we had the same poor coaches and ended up losing in the first round of the playoffs. This year I missed two games due to a shoulder injury. However, when I returned I played the best game I have ever played.</p>
    
     <div class="grid-item"><img src="sportImages/football4.jpg" alt="Photo 2"></div>
      <p>This was my freshman year of high school I already told yall about this but I had to add it to ther journey.</p>
