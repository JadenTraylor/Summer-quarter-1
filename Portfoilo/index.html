          <p>
           I know you might be wondering who I am, so here I am on the left. As it says on the front page, my name is Ja'Den Leo Traylor and I am 15 years old. One thing about me is that I really like to win and I don't like to lose. I am also a good listener; I really pay attention to what others say and then I share my own ideas. I am also very determined; I keep working on something until I finish it. Another thing about me is that I am a leader, not a follower. People admire me and want to do what I do, and many say I am a positive influence.

What I want to say is to never give up. I thought about quitting because I wasn't starting and wasn't getting to play, but when I finally got my chance, I showed them that I deserved to be there. </h4>

I ended up playing quarterback which was tough at first since I had never done it before. In the end, I became a decent quarterback, finishing the season with 13 touchdowns. What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't give up on something before you give it a try.</h4>
